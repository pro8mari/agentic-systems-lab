 # 🧠 Agentic Systems Lab

**Agentic Systems Lab** is my personal research space dedicated to exploring **agentic AI, multi-agent systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and modern architectures for LLM-driven applications.  
This repository documents my learning path, experiments, and evolving understanding of how intelligent agent systems are designed and deployed.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Develop a strong foundation in **agentic workflows** and autonomous LLM behaviors  
- Build and experiment with **single agents** and **multi-agent systems**  
- Explore architectural patterns for tool use, memory, coordination, and reasoning  
- Experiment with LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI and related frameworks  
- Grow toward **AI system architecture** through hands-on projects  
- Prepare for building real-world agentic applications and prototypes

## 🔬 Research Focus

This lab is not just a collection of scripts.  
It is a continuous R&D environment for:

- Conceptualizing new workflow patterns  
- Testing multi-agent interaction models  
- Experimenting with reasoning loops and planning strategies  
- Understanding tool orchestration and environment control  
- Exploring retrieval pipelines and knowledge-grounded systems  
- Developing an architectural mindset for building AI systems
